# F5 Security Automation Use-Cases with Ansible

### Summary
The typical security response process takes an hour or sometimes in days to remediate and triage for confirmed incidents by human experts. But this approach is not scalable at all, and it might not guarantee the required security remediation process on time for the organization. And this is why 'Security Automation' is getting more attention in the market. 'Security Automation' provides the required actions for a confirmed security alert in a programmatically way and remediate the threat with or without human intervention. 'Security Automation' also dramatically can reduce the possibility of human error during the investigation and remediation process. 

F5 and Redhat Ansible provides security automation in both traditional and modern app environment. This combined 'Security Automation' story can help the organizations fill the gap caused by a lack of security experts.   

### Goal
'Security Automation' can be used in organizations with different requirements from various personas. For example, NetSecOps and DevSecOps require different automation use-cases for remediating their security risks. Our goal is to demonstrate the various types of 'Security Automation' use-cases for the different personas - NetSecOps, DevSecOps, and SOC(Security Operation Center). Each security team can reference our use-cases to improve their response process.  

### Getting Started
1. Security Automation: NetSecOps
    - Automated F5 AFM Rule Management
2. Security Automation: DevSecOps
    - Automated Remediation of Unauthorized POD in OpenShift environment 
3. Security Automation: SOC

### Support
This project is a community effort to promote 'Security Automation' use-cases with F5 solutions and Redhat Ansible by F5 BD team. Feel free to open an issue for any feature requests or problems, and we will give our best effort to address it.
